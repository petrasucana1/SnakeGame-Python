# Snake Game with Obstacles and Advanced Visual Effects

This is an upgraded Snake Game built using Python and Pygame, featuring smooth movement, dynamic animations, and a more professional, modern look.  
The player controls a flexible snake that grows by eating fruits and must avoid colliding with itself or obstacles.

## ✨ Features:
### 🐍 Snake Movement and Animation:
- The snake smoothly undulates as it moves, with dynamic scaling (head thicker, tail thinner).
- Movement is controlled using the arrow keys.

### 🍏 Food:
- Multiple types of food: Apple, Pear, and Peach.
- Each food eaten is counted and displayed at the top.

### 🧱 Obstacles:
- Static obstacles like rocks and grass appear on the board.
- New obstacles are added every 3 points scored.

### 🌎 Boundaries:
- The snake wraps around the board edges and reappears on the opposite side.

### 🎵 Sound Effects:
- Custom sound effects for eating food and when the game ends.

### 🛡️ Visuals and Board:
- Checkerboard green background (inspired by the Google Snake Game).
- Thin green border surrounding the playing field.
- Food and obstacles have custom images with transparent backgrounds.
- Status bar at the top displays:
  - Number of each fruit eaten.
  - Total score.

### 🚫 Game Over:
- Collision with itself or an obstacle ends the game.
- Final score and high score are displayed.

## 🔥 How it Works:
### 🛠 Configuration:
- Uses a JSON file to define board size and initial obstacle positions.

### 🔁 Game Loop:
- Handles input, snake movement, collision detection, game state updates, and rendering.

### 🍴 Snake Evolution:
- Snake grows when it eats food.
- New food is generated randomly.
- Obstacles are progressively added to increase difficulty.

### 🧠 Collision Detection:
- Snake collision with itself or obstacles triggers the game over sequence.

## 📚 About This Project:
The **Advanced Snake Game** was created to move beyond basic Pygame concepts and learn about:
- Smooth animations and dynamic drawing.
- Better user interface design with status bars and icons.
- Handling assets (sounds, images) cleanly.
- Building a more polished and visually appealing game.

While still relatively simple, this project shows how thoughtful design and small details can greatly improve the player experience.
